# Real-Time-Language-Translator
This project demonstrates a Real-Time Language Translation System built using Neural Machine Translation (NMT). It enables instant translation of English text into Hindi and Kannada, leveraging Hugging Face MarianMT models for accurate, context-aware results.

The project provides two interfaces:

🌐 Flask Web App – a browser-based translation interface

⚡ Streamlit App – an interactive and lightweight UI

By combining deep learning with user-friendly design, this project helps bridge communication gaps across languages and can be extended to support additional languages and features like voice translation in the future.
